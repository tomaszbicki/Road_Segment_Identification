# Road_Segment_Identification

Governments around the world spend resources mapping roads in their countries to make sure that resources, such as emergency services and education, can reach as many people as possible. Many roads are constructed by the government, but many are created by people trying to reach a new location or creating a shortcut. New roads often pop up around development sectors such as mines and farms. In these cases, government officials need to physically confirm the presence of the road, measure and map the road, and ensure that it is usable.

The objective of this competition is to identify whether an image contains a road segment or not. Dry river beds, railway tracks and power lines could look like roads. It is important to classify these as “not roads”.

This will allow government officials to focus on areas they might need to send an official to confirm the road placement, and add it to the government’s maps and road networks. This is a small part of a larger project to fill in missing roads (i.e a more complete roads network), and also make sure that any current road network is properly joined (node to node), making network analysis easier.
